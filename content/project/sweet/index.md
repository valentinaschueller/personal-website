title: "SWEET x LibPFASST"
summary: "Ensuring interoperability of [SWEET](https://schreiberx.github.io/sweetsite/), a C++ shallow water equation solver, with [LibPFASST](https://github.com/libpfasst/LibPFASST), a lightweight Fortran implementation of the parallel-in-time [PFASST](https://pfasst.lbl.gov/what-is-pfasst) algorithm. I work on this as part of a student assistant job with [Martin Schreiber](https://www.martin-schreiber.info/), building on the work of Francois Hamon."
