I am a PhD student in numerical analysis at the [Centre for Mathematical Sciences at Lund University](https://www.maths.lu.se/english/). 
My research focuses on coupling algorithms for multiphysics problems, particularly for environmental models involving air and water flows. 
In this context, I study Schwarz waveform relaxation as a high-order black box coupling method.
