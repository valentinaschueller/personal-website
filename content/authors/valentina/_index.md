I am a PhD student in Numerical Analysis, supervised by [Philipp Birken](https://www.maths.lu.se/staff/philipp-birken). 
My research focuses on coupling algorithms for multiphysics problems, particularly for environmental models involving air and water flows. 
In this context, I study Waveform Relaxation as a high-order black box coupling method.
