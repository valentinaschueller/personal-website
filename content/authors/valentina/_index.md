I study [Computational Science and Engineering](https://www.in.tum.de/en/for-prospective-students/masters-programs/computational-science-and-engineering/) at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de), with a focus on time integration methods, computational fluid dynamics, and climate modelling. Next to university, I volunteer in the area of civic and political education.
